            <h1>How Heinz Came To Be</h1>
            <p class="text-lead">Once upon a time in a small town in Switzerland an idea was sparked. The idea was simple. It came from agreeing minds that the world was lacking a simple solution for building stories on the web. The minds decided to change that and fill the gap left by other storytelling tools they had found. They decided to build a lightweight framework that looked good, didn’t come with unnecessary bulk yet offered all the components a modern multi-media-story needs. Heinz was born.</p>
            <p>A lot of research was done. Heinz shouldn’t be some dusty old butler, Heinz was supposed to be compatible with the most current browsers, make use of amazing new specs of CSS like the CSS Grid, support flexbox, be completely responsive, fast and modular. </p>
            <p>Our Storytelling Butler was aimed to be different from large Frameworks like Bootstrap, it was supposed to be simpler, lighter and easier to get into. And also a lot prettier.</p>
            <p>We spent time on figuring out what we liked and din't like about the way stories were presented. A lot of it came with small copy that hurt our eyes, a lot of it came in colors that looked old-fashioned. We wanted our design to be beautiful, functional and make a statement.</p>
